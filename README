  Predicted score distributions under Item Response Theory models

For the code to work correctly, the working directory in the R session
must be changed (via the "setwd" function) to the base directory of
the supplemental material (i.e., the directory that contains this
README.txt file).

The R library inline must be installed and working correctly for the C++ to compile on the fly 

The files in the bugs directory are taken from Curtis, S.M. (2010) BUGS Code for Item Response Theory, 
Journal of Statistical Software, Vol. 36, Code Snippet 1

Below is a description of each file in the supplementary material.
